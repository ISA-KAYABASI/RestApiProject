# RestApiProject

I created an spring rest project. 
There is user informations ( id, name, lastname, email, password )
For database i used Hibernate (Jpa).
In project you can add,update,list and delete users. 
I used list method with @NamedQuery annotation.
For active methods i created JUnit tests and with succesfull tests i create one failed test which i ensure that method throw exception when test failed. 
In this project i used first time @NamedQuery and JUnit Tests.

Thank you for your time.
